# Strategic Planning and Task Decomposition

**Before any code modification:**
- Create a comprehensive plan using TodoWrite tool
- Break down complex tasks into small, human-comprehensible subtasks
- Each subtask should modify no more than 20-30 lines of code at once
- Ensure each step has a clear, verifiable outcome

## Example Task Breakdown

```
Large Task: "Implement user authentication system"
→ Subtask 1: Create user model schema
→ Subtask 2: Implement password hashing utility
→ Subtask 3: Create login endpoint
→ Subtask 4: Add authentication middleware
→ Subtask 5: Write unit tests for each component
```

## TodoWrite Usage Guidelines

- **Batch operations**: Read multiple files simultaneously when exploring
- **MultiEdit over Edit**: Combine related changes to same file
- **Progress tracking**: Update TodoWrite status immediately after each completion

## Quality Gates for Task Planning

**Never proceed without:**
- [ ] Clear understanding of the change being made
- [ ] Human-readable explanation of the modification
- [ ] Confirmation that the change aligns with project goals

**Note**: The 30-line limit aligns with the subtask sizing guideline for consistent change management.
